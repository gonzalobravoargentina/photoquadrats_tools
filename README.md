### **Photoquadrats_metadata.R**  
Generates metadata files compatible with **CoralNet** and **BIIGLE** platforms, simplifying photo annotation workflows.

#### Features:
- **BIIGLE Metadata:**
  - Extracts EXIF data.
  - Formats metadata fields to meet BIIGLE requirements.
  - Adds columns for ground distance and image area.
- **CoralNet Metadata:**
  - Formats metadata fields for CoralNet's requirements.
  - Adds standard fields (e.g., water quality, framing gear).
  - Prepares `.csv` files ready for upload.

### **Underwater_track.R**  
Analyzes underwater tracking data and visualizes dive paths and associated photo locations.

Tag photos along a GPS track on a map, enhancing the visualization and analysis of underwater data. This feature helps you geotag your photos, providing valuable insights into the geographical context of your underwater photoquadrats.
